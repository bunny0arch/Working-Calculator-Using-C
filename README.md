This is a efficient working calculator, made entirely using C language.
It contains basic easy to read switch cases and an infinite loop which has some funny logic to it.
Although this is limited to just operations on two numbers, it will surely be developed in such a way that it can handle operations just like an actual calculator.
Aiming it to be better than the windows defaulty in-built calculator cuz everybody knows, it sucks!
